SINCE YOU WENT AWAY
(Kris Delmhorst)

D                    Em 
Seems like to me the stars don't shine so bright
G                    D                      D/c#
Seems like to me the sun has lost its light 
Hm               Em
Seems like to me there's nothing going right
A                D
Since you went away

D                    Em
Seems like to me the sky ain't half so blue
G                D                    D/c#
Seems like to me everything wants you 
Hm                 Em
Seems like to me I don't know what to do
A                D
Since you went away

G
Everything is wrong
    E
The day is twice as long
        A A/g# A/f# A
And the bird forgot his song

D                Em
Seems like to me I just can't help but sigh
G                D                           D/c#
Seems like to me my throat keeps getting dry 
Hm               Em
Seems like to me a tear stays in my eye
A                D
Since you went away
A                D
Since you went away
A                D
Since you went away
